gcrypt
======
This project is a small encryption application that encrypts and decrypts files using the 256-bit AES block cipher for encryption, PBKDF2 for key stretching and derivation, and HMAC-SHA512 (over the ciphertext, KDF salt, and initialization vector) for file integrity and authenticity checking.
